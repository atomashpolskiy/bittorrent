/**
 * Implements the "rarest-first" piece selection algorithm.
 * As the name implies, pieces that appear less frequently
 * and are generally less available are selected in the first place.
 *
 * There are two "flavours" of the "rarest-first" strategy: regular and randomized.

 * Regular rarest-first selects whichever pieces that are the least available
 * (strictly following the order of increasing availability).
 *
 * Randomized rarest-first selects one of the least available pieces randomly
 * (which means that it does not always select THE least available piece, but rather looks at
 * some number N of the least available pieces and then randomly picks one of them).

 * @since 1.1
